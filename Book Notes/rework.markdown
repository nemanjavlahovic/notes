## Rework

by Jason Fried, David Heinemeier Hansson

### Chapter 1:
* Start referring to your business plans as business guesses, your financial plans as financial guesses and strategic plans as strategic guesses.
* If you write a big plan before starting any business, you'll most likely never look at it anyway.
* Decide what you are going to do this week, not this year.

### Chapter 2: Takedowns
* Workaholism is unnecessary. Working more does not mean getting more done, it just means working more.

### Chapter 3: Go
* Scratch your itch and start a business in industry you are already in.
* The idea is just a small part, big part is how you execute.
* Squeeze an extra hour every day if you want something to create; for instance make music. If you really want it, you'll make the time.
* Avoid outside funding, especially if starting a small software company.
* Start small, no need for too many expenses. Consider having essentials and doing unpleasant work yourself (eg: not having a support team but rather reply to emails yourself).
* Setup an actual business instead of startup, worrying about profit from day one.

### Chapter 4: Progress
* Constraints are advantage in disguise. Limited resources force you to make do eith what you've got.
* Figure out the foundation of your work and focus all your energy on making it the best it can be.
* Nail the basics first and worry about details later.
* Swap thinking to making decisions. Don't wait for the perfect solution.
* Focus on things that won't change.
* Think of a by-product of your work that you can sell.
* Best way to achieve a good product is through iterations.

### Chapter 5: Productivity
* Consider reasons to quit, among which can be solving imaginary problems, or not knowing why you are doing something.
* Ask yourself is there an easier way?
* Dedicate 'alone' time in office, when you're not being interupted by coworkers and meetings.
* Allocate fixed amount of time for meetings and address specific problems directly. Cut the abstract stuff.
* Having small, quick wins boosts momentum on whatever you are working on.
* When making estimate, break it into small time frames. And go one step at a time.
* Create smaller todo lists.

### Chapter 6: Competitors
* Underdo your competition, Cold War mentality is a dead end.

### Chapter 7: Evolution
* Say no by default.
* Don't confuse enthusiasm with priority.
* You can't paint a bad experience with good advertising or marketing.
* Build an audience - speak, write, blog, make videos. Share information that is valuable and you will build a loyal audience.
* Give a little away for free, as long as you've got something else to sell.
* Marketing is not just a few individual events, but rather a sum of everything you do. For instance, if you build software, every error message you show is marketing. Marketing is not a department.
* Get used that you won't be an overnight sensation.

### Chapter 8: Hiring
* Never hire anyone to do a job until you've tried to do it yourself first.
* How long someone's been doing it is overrated. What matters is how well they've been doing it.
* Hire the best talent, regardless of where they are located.

### Chapter 9: Damage Control
* When something bad happens, don't hide it under the rug. Tell your customers.
* Getting back to people quickly is the most important thing you can do when it comes to customer support.
* Don't protect the people doing the work from customer feedback.

### Chapter 10: Culture
* Culture is the byproduct of consistent behavior. If you encourage people to share, then sharing will be built into your culture.
* Don't create a policy because one person did something wrong once.
* Your greatest asset is to communicate simply, without running every last word through a legal department.
* Stop saying ASAP. It sounds hysterical.
